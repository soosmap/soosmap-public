# SOOSmap Repository
Welcome to the SOOSmap GitHub public repository! This repository contains public code and resources to help the users of SOOSmap access the abundance of scientific oceanographic data available within the SOOSmap portal. It also offers a platform for users to contribute to SOOSmap by reporting bugs/issues or suggesting new datasets to be included. Any feedback and contributions play a key role in improving the SOOSmap platform and expanding its data offerings!

## What is SOOSmap?
[SOOSmap](https://www.soosmap.aq) is an interactive platform designed to visualize and share oceanographic data, specifically focusing on the Southern Ocean and Antarctic regions, hosted by the [Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS)](https://soos.aq). Developed by the European Marine Observations and Data Network (EMODnet) Physics and supported by the Southern Ocean Carbon and Heat Impact on Climate (SO-CHIC) project, SOOSmap provides researchers and policymakers access to a wide range of carefully curated datasets from global oceanographic research programs.

The platform aggregates data from various observation platforms, such as Argo floats and plankton trawls, drawing from international data centers and repositories. Users can explore an extensive collection of circumpolar data contributed by research institutions worldwide, covering disciplines from marine biology to physical oceanography.

SOOSmap leverages vast datasets, including contributions from initiatives like Copernicus and EMODnet. Although these sources often focus on European seas, they encompass global oceans, making SOOSmap a valuable tool for Southern Ocean research. Additionally, the platform includes datasets uniquely relevant to the Antarctic, such as information on krill, sea ice, and marine plastics.

Since its launch in 2017, SOOSmap has continuously evolved, with a major update in 2023 that introduced a more user-friendly interface and faster data processing capabilities. The platform now hosts over 50 data layers and 50,000 observations, with plans to expand as new collaborations with international data centers continue. SOOSmap strives to offer a comprehensive resource for Southern Ocean data, enhancing scientific understanding of this critical region.

## Reporting a Bug/Issue
Sometimes things go wrong! We are a small team, doing our best, and need the help of the SOOSmap Community to report bugs or issues regarding data or the functionality of SOOSmap. If you discover such a thing, you can report it by following these steps:

1. Go to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/soosmap/soosmap-public/issues).
2. Select New Issue.
3. Choose the Bug Report template.
4. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue and any relevant screenshots or information.
5. Submit the issue, and our team will review and address it.

## Suggesting a New Dataset
SOOSmap is open to suggestions for what data are most important for the Southern Ocean Community to host! Feedback and requests are encouraged, so if there are data you would like us to host, please follow these steps:
1. Go to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/soosmap/soosmap-public/issues).
2. Select New Issue.
3. Choose the New Dataset template.
4. Provide as much detail as possible, including links to find the data, existing metadata records, and contact information.
5. Submit the issue, and we will evaluate its potential for integration into SOOSmap.
